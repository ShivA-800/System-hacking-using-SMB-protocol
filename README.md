# System-hacking-using-SMB-protocol

This project demonstrates system hacking using SMB exploitation techniques. It includes detailed documentation, methodologies, and findings from the research conducted.

## Overview

The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is widely used for network communication, file sharing, and resource access. This project investigates the exploitation of SMB vulnerabilities using the Metasploit framework, with a focus on understanding and mitigating these risks. The study was conducted in a controlled lab environment using Kali Linux as the attacking machine and Metasploitable2 as the vulnerable target.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Kali Linux**: A Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing.
- **Metasploit Framework**: A penetration testing platform that enables you to find, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities.
- **Metasploitable2**: A vulnerable machine designed for testing security tools and demonstrating common vulnerabilities.
- **Nmap**: A network scanning tool to discover hosts and services on a computer network.
- **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.
